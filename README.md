## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.10+
- MySQL (via [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/) recommended for Mac)

---

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AMS-MHSSCE.git
cd AMS-MHSSCE
```

---

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file inside `backend/`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://root:root@localhost:8889/ams_db
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_change_this_in_production
JWT_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
UPLOAD_FOLDER=uploads
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=20
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=True
```

> **Note:** If using MAMP on Mac, MySQL runs on port `8889` by default (not `3306`).

Seed the database with test data:

```bash
python seed.py
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
flask run --port 5001
```

Backend running at: `http://localhost:5001`

---

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

Open a new terminal:

```bash
# From project root
npm install
```

Create `src/.env.local`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

Start the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend running at: `http://localhost:8080`

---

### 4️⃣ Open in Browser

```
http://localhost:8080
```

Login with admin credentials and start creating courses, teachers, and students.

---

## 🔄 System Workflow

```
Admin creates users → Admin creates courses → Admin assigns teachers
    ↓
Admin enrolls students in courses
    ↓
Teacher marks attendance → Student sees attendance records
Teacher enters marks    → Student sees results + SGPA
Teacher uploads notes   → Student downloads files
    ↓
Admin posts announcements → All users see notifications
Admin posts drives        → Students apply for placement
Admin creates scholarships → AI checks eligibility → Students apply
    ↓
Students submit feedback → Teacher views analytics
AI calculates risk scores → Teacher identifies at-risk students
```

---

## 🤖 AI Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Success Guardian | Calculates risk score (0–100) per student based on attendance + marks |
| Scholarship Eligibility | Checks student SGPA against scholarship criteria automatically |

**Risk Score Formula:**
```
risk = 0
if attendance < 75%:  risk += 40
if attendance < 65%:  risk += 20  (additional)
if avg_marks < 40%:   risk += 40
if avg_marks < 30%:   risk += 20  (additional)
risk_score = min(risk, 100)

HIGH RISK   = 75–100  🔴
MEDIUM RISK = 50–74   🟡
LOW RISK    = 0–49    🟢
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication

- Only admin-created accounts can login
- New accounts start as `Pending` — admin must activate before login
- JWT tokens expire in 7 days
- Email format enforces role detection:
  - Student: `name.rollno.branch@mhssce.ac.in`
  - Teacher: `name.branch@mhssce.ac.in`
  - Admin: `admin@mhssce.ac.in`

---

## 📁 File Storage

All uploaded files are stored locally on the server:

| File Type | Folder |
|-----------|--------|
| Study notes | `uploads/notes/` |
| Student resumes | `uploads/resumes/` |
| Job brochures | `uploads/brochures/` |
| Admission documents | `uploads/admissions/` |
| Profile photos | `uploads/avatars/` |

Files are served at: `http://localhost:5001/uploads/...`

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
npm run test
```
